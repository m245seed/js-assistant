The evaluation of if-statements in JavaScript does not result in a value because they are statements, not expressions. In many situations, you might want to compute a value conditionally, and the conditional expression operator `?` is a better fit. When you are familiar with conditional expressions, single-level conditional expressions are more concise and often easier to understand than if-else statements.
