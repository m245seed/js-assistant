The destructuring assignment syntax is more concise than the traditional property access and offers more clarity.

You can also declare several variables in a single destructuring assignment with a single evaluation of the source expression. Using destructuring assignments reduces code duplication and removes the need to extract an expensive source expression computation into a separate variable.
