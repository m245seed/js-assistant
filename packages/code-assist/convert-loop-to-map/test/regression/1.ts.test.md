## Input
```javascript input
const combinedDiffs: { diff: RangeMapping; input: 1 | 2 }[] = [];

for (const diffs of baseRange.input1Diffs) {
  combinedDiffs.push(
    ...diffs.innerRangeMappings.map((diff) => ({ diff, input: 1 as const }))
  );
}
for (const diffs of baseRange.input2Diffs) {
  combinedDiffs.push(
    ...diffs.innerRangeMappings.map((diff) => ({ diff, input: 2 as const }))
  );
}
```

## Configuration
```json configuration
{
  "extension": "ts"
}
```

## Expected Output
```javascript expected output
const combinedDiffs: { diff: RangeMapping; input: 1 | 2 }[] = baseRange.input1Diffs.flatMap((diffs) => {
  return diffs.innerRangeMappings.map((diff) => ({ diff, input: 1 as const }));
});

for (const diffs of baseRange.input2Diffs) {
  combinedDiffs.push(
    ...diffs.innerRangeMappings.map((diff) => ({ diff, input: 2 as const }))
  );
}
