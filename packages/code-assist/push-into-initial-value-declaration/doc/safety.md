#### The variable type can change
When the two variable declarations have different types, and the first declaration declares several variables, the broader type needs to be used.

This means that `const` can be changed into `let` or `var`, and `let` can be changed into `var`. The change to `let` means that previously constant variables now can be modified, and the change to `var` can change the scope of the variable.

Consider the following example:
```javascript
const intermediateVariable = someSource(),
      anotherVariable = anotherSource();
var aVariable = intermediateVariable;
```

Here, pushing up `aVariable` and removing `intermediateVariable` requires changing the `const` to `var` to support the scope of `aVariable`. This refactoring changes the scope of `anotherVariable` as well.

Similarly, pushing a `const` variable into a function or catch clause parameter means it will become modifiable.

#### Exports can be affected
When one of the two variable declarations is exported, the refactoring can impact the module's exports.

For example,
```javascript
export const obj = something;
const aVariable = obj;
```
becomes
```javascript
export const aVariable = something;
```

This change impacts the module's exports, and you might need to update references to it inside other modules as well. If the exports are library exports, this could be a breaking change.

#### The execution order can change when inlining destructuring
Destructuring can have side effects when e.g., getters are invoked. When pushing up a variable into its definition, it can affect the execution order.

Here is an example: 
```javascript
const executed = [];

class Example {

    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    get field() {
        executed.push(`${this.name} - field`);
        return "field";
    }

    get innerExample() {
        executed.push(`${this.name} - inner example`);
        return new Example("inner");
    }
}

const { innerExample: intermediateVariable, field } = new Example("outer");
const { field: innerField } = intermediateVariable;

console.log(executed); // [ 'outer - inner example', 'outer - field', 'inner - field' ]
```

After the refactoring, the bottom part becomes:
```javascript
const { innerExample: { field: innerField }, field } = new Example("outer");

console.log(executed); // [ 'outer - inner example', 'inner - field', 'outer - field' ]
```

`inner - field` is now added to `executed` before `outer - field`.

#### The TypeScript type can be narrowed
When the intermediate variable is part of a destructuring expression, the type information from the inlined variable is dropped. This can lead to a narrowing of the type.

```javascript
const { value: intermediateVariable }: {value: "123"} = {
  value: "123"
}

const aVariable: string = intermediateVariable;
```
becomes
```javascript
const { value: aVariable }: {value: "123"} = {
  value: "123"
}
// now aVariable has type "123" and not string
```
