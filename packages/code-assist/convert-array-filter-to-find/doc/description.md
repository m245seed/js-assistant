[Array.find(…)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) was introduced in ES2015 (ES6).
It returns the first element of an array for which the testing function parameter returns a truthy value. 

Before the introduction of `array.find(…)`, it was common to use the first element from a filtered result instead, i.e., `array.filter(…)[0]`. This refactoring modernizes the older expression.
