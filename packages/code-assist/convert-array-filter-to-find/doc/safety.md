#### Target object might not be an array
`.filter` can be called on any object that has a `filter` method. When the object does not provide a `find` method, and both `find` and `filter` have similar semantics to the standard JavaScript array, this refactoring can change the behavior of your code.

#### Adds 'undefined' to type
If you are using TypeScript without checked index access (`--noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), then this refactoring changes the return type of the expression. For the array access `[0]`, TypeScript assumes that the element exists (even though it could be `undefined`). However, when switching to `.find`, `undefined` is part of the return type. This can help you uncover potential bugs.
