Editing multiple occurrences of an expression is useful in many cases, e.g., to fix code snippets after copy-pasting them. 

Visual Studio Code allows you to select multiple occurrences of the same text, but this can be imprecise especially for very short variable names. The "select expression occurrences" uses semantic equality, not text equality.
