# Documentation

You can find the actions in the **quick fix** and **refactoring context menus**. They depend on the cursor position, the selected text (if any), the source code, the language type, and any available type information.
**Underlining with three dots** suggests beneficial refactorings that you can perform. The **suggestion panel** shows you recommended refactorings for your whole file.

# Code Assists by Category
Code assists that belong to several categories appear more than once.
